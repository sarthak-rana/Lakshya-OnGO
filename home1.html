					<hr id="Hr">
					<div id="Blog_Content">
						<p>As a student, learning Japanese helps you gain broader perspectives, higher thinking skills and new learning strategies that you can apply to your other academic subjects.</p>
						<P>Other Asian nations, such as Korea, China and India exerted influence over Japanese history. Although the Asian cultures are different, they also share some similarities, which you'll be able to recognize when you study the language. You'll see the values they share with the country, including aesthetics, ethics and religious beliefs.</P>
						<p>Japan is a nation that is geographically isolated. Considering the devastation of the country during WWII and the fact that natural resources are scarce in the island, it's impressive how the Japanese were able to turn things around. It is astonishing how the Japanese were able to rely on their scientific knowledge and creativity to make their country economically successful. They are leaders in various fields of technology such as fermentation processes, industrial robotics, semiconductor manufacturing, electronics and optical media. They are great innovators, attested by their being on top of the list of patent filings in the world. Each year, around 420,000 patent applications are filed by Japanese inventors.</p>

					<hr id="Hr">
					<div id="Blog_Content">
						<p>Japan was settled about 35,000 years ago by Paleolithic people from the Asian mainland. At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a culture called the Jomon developed. Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels. According to DNA analysis, the Ainu people may be descendants of the Jomon.</p>
						<P>The second wave of settlement by the Yayoi people introduced metal-working, rice cultivation, and weaving to Japan. DNA evidence suggests that these settlers came from Korea.</P>
						<p>The first era of recorded history in Japan is the Kofun (A.D. 250-538), which was characterized by large burial mounds or tumuli. The Kofun were headed by a class of aristocratic warlords; they adopted many Chinese customs and innovations.</p>
						<p>Buddhism came to Japan during the Asuka period, 538-710, as did the Chinese writing system. At this time, society was divided into clans. The first strong central government developed during the Nara period (710-794). The aristocratic class practiced Buddhism and Chinese calligraphy, while agricultural villagers followed Shintoism.</p>
						<p>Japan's unique culture developed rapidly during the Heian era (794-1185). The imperial court turned out enduring art, poetry, and prose. The samurai warrior class developed at this time as well.</p>
						<p>Samurai lords, called "shogun," took over the government in 1185, and ruled Japan in the name of the emperor until 1868. The Kamakura Shogunate (1185-1333) ruled much of Japan from Kyoto. Aided by two miraculous typhoons, the Kamakura repelled attacks by Mongol armadas in 1274 and 1281.</p>
						<p>A particularly strong emperor, Go-Daigo, tried to overthrow the shogunate in 1331, resulting in a civil war between competing northern and southern courts that finally ended in 1392. During this time, a class of strong regional lords called "daimyo" increased in power; their rule lasted through the end of the Edo period, also known as the Tokugawa Shogunate, in 1868.</p>
						<p>That year, a new constitutional monarchy was established, headed by the Meiji Emperor. The power of the shoguns came to an end.</p>
						<p>After the Meiji Emperor's death, the emperor's son became the Taisho Emperor. His chronic illnesses kept him away from his duties and allowed the country's legislature to introduce new democratic reforms. During World War I, Japan formalized its rule over Korea and seized control of northern China.</p>

						<h3>Government</h3>
						<p>Japan has a constitutional monarchy, headed by an emperor. The current emperor is Akihito; he wields very little political power, serving primarily as the symbolic and diplomatic leader of the country.</p>
						<p>The political leader of Japan is the Prime Minister, who heads the Cabinet. Japan's bicameral legislature is made up of a 465-seat House of Representatives and a 242-seat House of Councillors.</p>
						<p>Japan has a four-tier court system, headed by the 15-member Supreme Court. The country has a European-style civil law system.</p>
						<p>Shinz≈ç Abe is the current Prime Minister of Japan.</p>
						<h3>Economy</h3>
						<P>Japan is one of the most technologically advanced societies on Earth; as a result, it has the world's third largest economy by GDP (after the U.S. and China). Japanese exports include automobiles, consumer and office electronics, steel, and transportation equipment. Imports include food, oil, lumber, and metal ores.</P>
						<p>Economic growth stalled in the 1990s, but since has rebounded to a quietly respectable 2 percent per year. Per capita GDP in Japan is $38,440; 16.1 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.</p>
						<h3>Geography</h3>
						<p>The Japanese archipelago includes more than 3,000 islands, covering a total area of 377,835 square kilometers (145,883 square miles). The four main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.</p>
						<p>Japan is largely mountainous and forested, with arable land making up only 11.6 percent of the country. The highest point is Mount Fuji, at 3,776 meters (12,385 feet). The lowest point is Hachiro-gata, which sits at four meters below sea level (-12 feet).</p>
						<p>Positioned astride the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan features a number of hydrothermal features such as geysers and hot springs. The country suffers frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.</p>

					<h3 id="Blog_Topic">Career in Japan</h3>
					<hr id="Hr">
					<div id="Blog_Content">
						<p>As the Asian economy rises, more opportunities for work would be available. Japanese is a language that is not commonly taught or studied, like French, German or Spanish. Learning Japanese will boost your professional value. When you learn Japanese, you'll have less competition in opportunities available in different fields, such as business, social sciences, humanities, technology, science, journalism and tourism. If you want to be a translator for the government or a language services provider, your competition is lower when you speak Japanese compared to other more commonly taught languages.</p>
						<P>You could also have better chances of promotion. If you're working of an international corporation, speaking a foreign language like Japanese creates more opportunities for you to be assigned to an overseas branch.</P>
